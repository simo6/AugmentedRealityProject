# Augmented Reality Project
This work describes an Augmented Reality System to superimpose an artificial layer onto a recognized target object. The specific case study is the following: given an input video showing the well-known “Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision” book, our goal is to draw a realistic image on it. Thus, the superimposition must be robust to orientation changes, as well as translation and bright changes.
